<p>
  The Form Builder works by taking one of your form Views and converting that
  configuration into an attractive form to publish on your website. The module lets
  you choose a template set (a group of templates, each determining the appearance of
  different aspects of the form) to precisely control the appearance of the published
  forms. The Form Builder window let's you visually build your form by choosing
  options in the left sidebar. When you're ready to publish the form, you click the
  <i>Publish</i> Action Button at the bottom right to specify where it should get
  generated, then click "Publish" and you're done!
</p>

<p>
  In a nutshell, that's how it works!
</p>

<h4>A little more info about Views</h4>

<p>
  A Form Tools form can have any number of <i>Views</i>. The View controls various
  aspects of your published form, for example:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>What form fields should appear,</li>
  <li>The order the fields should get listed,</li>
  <li>How the fields are grouped within a page, and</li>
  <li>Whether the fields are arranged into tabs when editing the data in the Form
    Tools interface.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Since Views already define all this for us, the Form Builder simply takes that
  information and renders it with templates, thus creating your form. Any time you
  change your form View (e.g. add or remove fields to it), any published form that
  uses it will be <i>automatically updated</i> to show the changes. You don't need
  to re-save or re-publish the form.
</p>

<div class="tip">
  <b>Tip</b>: <b>tabs or pages?</b> The Form Builder converts View <i>tabs</i> into
  form <i>pages</i>. So if your View groups your fields into two tabs, your published
  form will contain two form pages + an optional Review page, plus the "thankyou" /
  "receipt" page. It's always a good idea to define the tab name, because that
  controls the page title of the first form page.
</div>

<h4>Template Sets</h4>

<p>
  The template sets govern exactly how your published form will look. The Template
  Sets let you customize the HTML, CSS and any javascript you wish to include in the
  form pages.
</p>

<p>
  A template set is comprised of multiple templates, each used to generate a
  particular part of the page. For example, there are Header and Footer templates,
  a Continue Block and Navigation templates. If your template set contains more
  than one of each type, you will be given the option of selecting it in the
  "TEMPLATES" section of the Form Builder sidebar. In effect, this lets you re-use
  the same template set multiple times, but generate different-looking forms each
  time.
</p>

<p>
  For a more in-depth look at template sets, choose the Form Builder module from
  your Modules page, select a Template Set and click around the interface to see how
  it's put together.
